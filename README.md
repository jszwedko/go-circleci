## circleci

Go library and CLI for interacting with CircleCI's API.

Currently a work-in-progress, so please see:
- `godoc github.braintreeps.com/jszwedko/circleci` for API usage
- `circleci -h` for the current CLI usage

To install the CLI (this will change once things have stabilized):
- `git clone github.braintreeps.com/jszwedko/circleci $GOPATH/src/github.braintreeps.com/jszwedko/circleci`
- `go install github.braintreeps.com/jszwedko/circleci/...`
